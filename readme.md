Main OOPs Features
    - Inheritance
    - Polymorphism
    - Abstraction
    - Encapsulation

Inheritance - allows child class(sub class/derived class) to inherit
attributes (properties) and behaviour(methods) of a parent class (super class/base class)
 is-a relationship

-Method overriding is considered to be a runtime polymorphism

-The Liskov Substitution Principle states that 
subclasses should be substitutable for their base classes

-Interface Segregation Principle Segregation means keeping things separated, 
and the Interface Segregation Principle is about separating the interfaces.

The principle states that many client-specific interfaces are better 
than one general-purpose interface. Clients should not be forced to implement a 
function they do no need. 

Why interfaces
    -Multiple inheritance 
    -Achieve Abstraction 
    -Specification (API) - Application programming interface...
